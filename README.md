We choose the first use case: "Predict stock market price for Norwegian airlines".
For this use case we looked into what type of algorithms would work best. When reserching linear regression algorithms we found that one of the major uses are for when predicting / forecasting a trend of next values. The regression might be used to identify the strength of the effect that the independent variable have on a dependent variable. This seemed to fit well with what our use case was asking for.
